- Avaliable column is exactly that
  - has google doc with the template for writing in the comments, the doc has the fixate format standards
  - open up the google doc and edit as needed if it's assigned to you
  - sometimes there will be unauthored posts
- Don't move cards to other columns from Available, tag Debi and say you want it.
- You get a week to write an article
- You can move the ticket to In Progress yourself once it's assigned to you
- Move it to Peer Review 1 yourself when you've finished writing
- There is a google doc with Peer Review instructions on the google docs for the articles.

- If you're a peer reviewer, move it to the next column. 

Then it goes through a lot of behind-the-scenes process. Once it completes all the lists on this board it goes to published posts.

- May go to vendor blog or Sweetcode vendor post. 

Published Posts
- There will be a url in the comments of where the post is. 
- Sometimes they don't have working titles, you can create a new card as needed (th title of the card "company - the title")
- Once it's in the Suggested by Contributor list, Debi will pitch it to the client and it may get approved by the client. 

When in doubt if you can write something, do some research on it and see if you can write a quality article based off your research.
